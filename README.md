# homework-4
This week's homework is to create a code quiz about JavaScript by using JavaScript.

The HTML portion of this homework wasn't too bad. It was short and simple based that it is only a quiz.

The CSS for this homework was also very simplistic since this homework assignment is going to be based off mostly JavaScript.
