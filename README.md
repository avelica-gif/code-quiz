# homework-4
This week's homework is to create a code quiz about JavaScript by using JavaScript.

The HTML portion of this homework wasn't too bad. It was short and simple based that it is only a quiz.

The CSS for this homework was also very simplistic since this homework assignment is going to be based off mostly JavaScript.

Re-submitting this assignment because back then I was too scared to ask questions and I didn't know how to deply or knew what I was doing.
